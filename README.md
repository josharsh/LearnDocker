<h3>:whale2:About</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/docker">Docker</a> is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers - standardized executable components combining application source code with the Operating System (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify the delivery of distributed applications, and have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/docker">IBM</a>, 2021). This repository will teach you the basics of Docker including:</p>

<ul>
 <li>How to create a DockerFile</li>
 <li>Networking in Docker</li>
 <li>Understanding Docker Volumes</li>
 <li>And the basics of running commands with a Docker File</li>
</ul>

<h3>:scroll:Contribution Guidelines</h3>
<p>This is an open source repository which means anyone can contribute to make this repository better...hopefully. To ensure that each contribution is an improvement, we ask that you follow a few basic guidelines:</p>

<ul>
 <li>First and foremost <b>be polite</b>, you may be an open source veteran who's been in the game for who knows how long, we get it. This isn't your first rodeo. Please  use your experience to help others out, we all start somewhere and sometimes a few tips & tricks are all we need to hit the ground running.</li>
 
 <li>Second, <b>if you see something, say something</b>. There will always be things to fix, that's just the nature of collaborative work. If you come across a bug, or something that could use a little love, create an issue for it. Give it a descriptive title and add as much detail as you can so that you or whoever then fixes it knows where to start.</li>
 
 <li>Third, <b>have some fun</b>. This is a great place to start your open source journey and learn what it means to contribute to larger workflows. And if/when you get stuck, or you simply don't know where to start, checkout <a href="http://makeapullrequest.com/">Make a Pull Request</a> or <a href="http://www.firsttimersonly.com/">First Timers Only</a> for some inspiration.</li> 
</ul>
